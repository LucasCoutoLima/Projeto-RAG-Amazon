      "Question:\n",
      "will this work with 3500 watt portable generator?\n",
      "\n",
      "Original answer:\n",
      "Yes it will. You don't want to use a ferroresonant transformer (like a Sola) with a generator. Ferroresonant transformers can become unstable with frequency variation that is more likely with a generator. This type of line conditioner uses an autotransformer which will just adjust taps to compensate for lower (or higher) voltage. If your generator bogs down for a short time, like when your refrigerator kicks on, the lower frequency will simply pass through the autotransfomer. Most electronics internally convert to DC and the power supplies are typically rated at 50 or 60 Hz, so no harm to your electronics on the intermittant low frequency.\n",
