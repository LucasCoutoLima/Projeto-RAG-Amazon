      "Context: I have a number of &#34;prosumer&#34; cameras like the Kodak Zi8, the Canon Vixia or DSLRs like the Nikon D5100.  All of these cameras feature stereo  microphone jacks, but most  microphones have mono plugs.  This adapter allows me to use two microphones at the same time, keeping each discreetly on the left and right channels.  I then dump the video into Sony Vegas or Final Cut Pro X and either mix down both channels as is, or manually adjust each channel in the mix for optimal This adapter splits a Tip-Ring-Sleeve stereo microphone (or speaker) jack into two mono Tip-Sleeve jacks, one for the left channel and one for the right. This is great for recording interviews: clip one lapel mic on one person, another on the second, and record both at the same  can also use this adapter to split a headphone jack into separate left and right channels to use with speakers. You may have to amplify the signal or perform impedance matching for this application, I wasn't sure whether this would work correctly, as my standard practice of putting one lav mic in the stereo jack always put out sound in the left channel only.  I asked around with some other filmmakers and they said they thought it would work, so I gave it a try.  I plugged one lav mic into each of the jacks (tip and ring, I think the one marked &#34;ring&#34; is right) and got perfect separated  you, I'm using a Zoom H2 audio recorder, and the mic power is on, and the Does just what I wanted -- I combine two microphones for a stereo input on a Zoom H2n recorder.  Also works for the advertised purpose, to split a stereo source into two mono  wanted a cable-based adapter rather than a single-piece unit, so this was great for me. I use a cam recorder to record Church Services.  We have a system of mikes that miss some of the service. I added a small mike but could not record on both mike systems.  With this I can connect and record on both mike systems as left and right mono tracks recorded on one stereo track. When processing the video I remove the sound track and break it to left and right mono tracks.  A track for each mike system.  I then load the 2 mono tracks on my video in place of the one stereo track and  edit Thought it was an issue with my microphones picking it up, until I unplugged one of them and both channels were still reading the exact  they do Is mix the two channels. It still outputs in mono, not in  recommendation is to instead get a usb soundcard that has multiple SEPERATE inputs. Then use Voicemeeter or Audacity to make it input from different channels then merge the two into stereo. I needed to feed two mono sources into a stereo audio  stereo breakout cable did the job. One mono source was recorded to one of the stereo 'sides', and the other mono track was recorded to the other stereo 'side'. In post, I can change the stereo track to a dual mono track and individually adjust the level of each of the two audio inputs.\n",

Made in  polarizes the light coming through your lens--twist the two-piece filter ring to see the 's not easy to operate with a lens hood on. I reach into the hood to twist the filter ring, but that blocks part of the viewfinder while I'm doing it. Not a huge problem. Tiffen makes a good filter.  I've used them for years and never been disappointed.  I even had a UV protector on the lens of a DSLR that fell off the fridge once.  The Tiffen UV filter did break, unsurprisingly, but the actual lens did not break.  So the UV filter served its :  you almost always want to have either a Circular Polarizer (this filter) or a UV filter on your camera.  You can look up what a CP does; I'm not going to go into it here, but either filter serves I have used these for many years and this was a replacement for one that I unfortunately dropped from a bridge to the water below.  It is a great filter, easy to manipulate and gets great results.  Certainly one of the best values in polarizing filters around.  I highy recommend. Perfect filter and does as well as the higher priced filters. Tiffen is the name to trust for filters. The filter was shipped in an open plastic box, no plastic bag to wrap the filter. The filter was quite dirty when it came. Bought 3 Tiffen filters and all three are like  thinking whether I should return this. Works  not over tighten it on other filters.

I should have heeded his assessment and steered away from this product. a removable wire organizer, it works well except that it covers the label &#34;in-out&#34; for coax input. Product is low profile but feels solid and the 10 foot angle cord is an excellent feature to have. / Coaxial surge protection and rightly so..BUT it fails to include an input jumper cable of each type so one can actually use it right out of the box.

But why would they include these on it if they are worthless you may ask yourself?That my friend is a great question.  Allow me to  off let me explain the little annoying as it doesn't come straight down, but angles to the right when plugged in.  This is, I'm sure, so that you can plug multiple ones into the same outlet (bad idea) but it is an inconvenience for me because my cord needs to run to the left from the  co-ax protection does not seem to degrade my signal strength as reported by my television, contrary to some of the other reviewers.

      "Context: I just bought this e260 (11/08). The player itself was manufactured in 2006 and still being sold as new by Amazon and JR's Computer  product information fails to leave out the fact that you can only use a 2gb mirco sd card, it will not recognize anything else. So forget about SDHC  of compatibility you can not hear  book content on it and will never be able  you want album art you have to find it on the internet and install Please excuse the fact that this isn't actually a review, but I'm striking out as I look for info about the e260's expansion  question is this: are these e260's compatible with SDHC cards (or only SD, the older, slower format), and will it support 4gb, 6gb, and 8gb cards?There are issues with some of the e250's. We have two of them, one is a \"Version 2\" and the other is not. The version 2 takes 4 GB cards; the other one does not. The Version 2 plays audible book Sandisk Sansa e260 is a great MP3 to have. It holds just the right amount of music to workout to, yard work or just to relax and listen to. Audible Audio books, you cannot listen to them on this player.  When I connected to Audible to attempt to download my library of audio books to the device, Audible's Download Manager told me that the E200 series players are not compatible with Audible without a Firmware update.  Well, that update didn't let me listen to audible books and cause other errors that ended up with the device  not for the firmware issue I had and the button placement, this would be a full on 5 I like this player but mine does not like micro SDHC cards.  Google search \"Sansa e260\"+\"SDHC\" before buying this player if you need micro SDHC memory expansion.  I read somewhere that on the lower right hand side of the player if \"e260 v2\" is printed then it can accept SDHC 4GB and larger memory cards.  Else it is limited to 2GB micro SD card. This Sandisk Sansa e260 is great. It even plays videos and has an sd card expansion slot! I ditched my ipod nano for this Sansa. And so far i am not regretting it. It has more features than the nano. The only things that the Nano beats the Sansa in is that Itunes automatically loads music onto the nano and the click wheel is a little better, well the sansa's click wheel isnt as sensible as the nanos and that sometimes is a good thing. I really love the Sansa, and like i said i used to have a Have had my Sansa e260 for over 2 weeks now.  No problems so far.  Have read many complaints about the navigation wheel and location of the control buttons beside the wheel, but I find both to work just fine.  Only problem I have encountered is lack of a bookmark function foraudio books, otherwise would have rated it 5 stars.\n",
